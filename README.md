# Snake
I used Pygame to create this, a very simple 'snake' type game with SFX and a score-saving feature, read the README.txt for more info.
the highscore ONLY updates after exiting the program, use 'w' to move up, 'a' to move to the left, 's' to move down and 'd' to move right.
you can change the sound effects by simply getting an mp3, and naming it the same name then replacing whatever effect you want to name, for example:
if you want to change the background music you will need to name an mp3 file 'bgmusic.mp3' and then replace the one which already exists.
i will post major updates here:
